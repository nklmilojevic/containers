"""The `time` component: seconds since midnight <-> Home Assistant's clock.

The W7H schedules its two water-treatment cycles as a time of day, stored as
SECONDS since midnight (43200 is noon) while HA's MQTT time platform speaks
`HH:MM:SS`. Three places do the translation and they must agree — the discovery
value template rendering for HA, `handle_ha_command` parsing HA's write, and the
web panel's own control emitting the same shape.
