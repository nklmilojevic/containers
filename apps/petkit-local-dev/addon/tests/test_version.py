"""The version must be the same number in all three places that state it.

`config.yaml` is what the Supervisor offers as an update, `pyproject.toml` is
what the package says it is, and `utils/const.VERSION` is what the panel shows
the user. They are three separate files, and a release that bumps two of them
leaves the running add-on reporting a version nobody shipped — which is worse
than showing nothing, because it is believed.
