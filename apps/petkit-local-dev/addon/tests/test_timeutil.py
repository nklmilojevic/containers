"""Tests for utils/timeutil.py, with DST as the point of the exercise.

A day is not 86400 seconds twice a year, and the bug these tests guard against
is subtle in exactly the wrong way: `start + 86400` looks obviously correct and
silently drops an hour of events every spring and double-counts one every
autumn. Europe/Warsaw is used because it is the reference install's zone and it
observes DST; the assertions are about the arithmetic, not about Poland.
