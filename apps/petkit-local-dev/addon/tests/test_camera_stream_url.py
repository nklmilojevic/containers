Two things are being defended here. The URL that reaches Home Assistant must be
the RTSP one, because HA opens whatever it is given with PyAV and the device's
own FLV segfaults libav and restarts the whole of HA. And the gate must be an
observation of the device, not our own record of having patched it.
